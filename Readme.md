# Accelerator Indicator

A simple, small, unobtrusive visual indicator when the accelerator is currently pressed.

Similar to Miss's Dashboard and Xertrov's AK indicator plugins.

## Why?

I use the "Toggle Accelerate" TM setting due to hand strain.

But it's sometimes difficult to tell if I'm accelerating or not. 

I have to rely on audio cues from engine sounds or the Dashboard plugin.

Dashboard's input display works great, but it displays ALL inputs.

I wanted a smaller, simpler, indicator that I can place near near my car without being distracting.
